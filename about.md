This is the BioHack Academy documentation site of Svekke.
What about me? I am 23 yearrs old and born and Living in Belgium (Flanders)

### Studies

Well I am currently a student on the KULeuven in Belgium as an engineer with a minor in biology.
In the past i did studies for an electrician and welder/fabricator.

### Work

A few years back I started a company. The company main focus is in garden maintenance but does other things like painting or building driveways. Next to this i am a hobbyfarmer with chickens.

### Hobby's

I really like formula 1 racing and watch all the races live on TV even if that makes me get out of bed early or get me to bed way to late.
Genealogy I find very interesting. Doing this already a few years and have over 20.000 people in my 'tree'.

### Volunteer

I volunteer as a animator for children, mainly in their vacation and try to give them the best vacation every time again.
Try to help society? I try. BCG is an organisation that collects plastic caps from bottles and sell them to smelting factories. with that money they buy food for the dogs and fund the breeding and training of the dogs, I myself do the collecting of the caps mainly in bars and schools.
